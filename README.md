# Shark (Hive on Spark)

Shark is a large-scale data warehouse system for Spark designed to be compatible with
Apache Hive. It can answer Hive QL queries up to 100 times faster than Hive without
modification to either the existing data or queries. Shark supports Hive's query language,
metastore, serialization formats, and user-defined functions.

Shark 0.9.2 requires:
* Scala 2.10.3 (packaged already in Shark)
* AMPLab's Hive 0.11 (packaged already in Shark)
* Spark 0.9.1
